  ## Mission 


  Supporting incarcerated and marginalized individuals as they successfully transition into society, with a focus on lifestyle changes, education, and a strong spiritual foundation.




  ## Vision


  We believe that transformational change within communities requires profound strength and integrity within each individual.  We believe that education in all its forms is a practice of freedom.  We engage individuals as they move into greater efficacy and deepening respect for themselves and others.  We believe in partnering across all service and nonprofit sectors within our communities in order to effect transformational change. Above all else, we believe that God is love, and that we are meant to serve as God’s ‘heart and hands and feet’ everywhere we go.
