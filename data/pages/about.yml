  ## Mission


  Supporting incarcerated and marginalized individuals as they successfully transition into society, with a focus on lifestyle changes, education, and a strong spiritual foundation.


  <br>


  ## Vision


  We believe that transformational change within communities requires profound strength and integrity within each individual.  We believe that education in all its forms is a practice of freedom.  We engage individuals as they move into greater efficacy and deepening respect for themselves and others.  We believe in partnering across all service and nonprofit sectors within our communities in order to effect transformational change. Above all else, we believe that God is love, and that we are meant to serve as God’s ‘heart and hands and feet’ everywhere we go.

  **Pastor Eddie Perez**


  Pastor Eddie founded Impact Ministry in 2004 while serving a life sentence. The Lord called him to serve his fellows in 12-step recovery, getting extra food for the less fortunate inside prison walls, assisting the mentally ill, as well as those addicted to the lifestyle of criminal and gang behavior. In 2014, Pastor Eddie had already been released three years when the Lord called him again while he was taking a run on the beach. He was told to make Impact into a community ministry in Santa Barbara — at this time he was attending South Coast Church, and pastor Rino Datillo placed Impact under the cover of SCC so that the ministry could move forward. There have been countless amazing testimonies that have taken place through Impact Ministry that we will be sharing. Pastor Eddie married Alice Perez in 2014; they have worked in this ministry together and they have also worked together in our local Santa Barbara County Jail to serve our brothers and sisters who are incarcerated.

  **Chaplain Alice Perez**


  I came up in a family where prayer was more than simply saying grace at meals. My father and mother fostered in me a deep love of God and a love for others and they gave me such a clear picture of Covenant marriage and committed active faith. I long to bring this legacy into my faith, marriage, and chaplaincy with Impact Ministry.
