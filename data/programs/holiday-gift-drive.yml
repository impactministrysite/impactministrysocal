  Through the generous donations of community members, Impact Ministry was able
  to bring a bit of hope during this past Christmas 2019 season —  making it
  possible to buy 145 Christmas Gift Bags for the women and 32 men at the jail.
  [Here’s a brief 30-second video of the Christmas Gifts at the SB County
  Jai](https://youtu.be/PK4kFYHKTk4)l, and the most recent baptism in one of the
  men’s units. As an extension of SCC, we’ve been able to bring a bit of hope
  during this holy season.

  Impact plans to expand the Christmas Gift Bag program for 2020 by providing gifts to all female and male inmates housed in the SB County Jail — We will keep you posted about the fundraiser for this program — look for further details this June!
