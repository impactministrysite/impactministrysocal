body: Impact Ministry hopes to offer a 12-week, Level 1 Chaplain Certification
  Training course beginning Summer 2020, depending on how our county progresses
  through COVID. We are currently teaching a 6-week prerequisite class, “Faith
  In Action,” with a group of male students in the jail. Impact’s goal is to
  offer all three levels of the Chaplain Certification Training Program in
  2021-2022.
