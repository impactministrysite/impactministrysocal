We are currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge across the world. Coronavirus (COVID-19) has united us in the realization that human life is fragile and precious. And in an era that is so deeply politicized, the mass quarantine that has affected many countries is an uncommon moment of shared experience.

## Faith over fear

This is a final sentiment. And a final test statement.
